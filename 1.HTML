<h2>DRAKE'S</h2>

<img src="drake's.jpg">
<BR>>Drake’s was founded by Michael Drake in East London in 1977, a short walk from the city’s silk weaving roots in Spitalfields. Originally a maker of men’s ‘Scarves, Shawls and Plaids,’ the company soon expanded into handmade ties and handkerchiefs, its designs gaining a reputation for quality amongst the high-end boutiques and department stores of Paris, Milan, Tokyo and New York.
